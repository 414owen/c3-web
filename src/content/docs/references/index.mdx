# What is C3?

C3 is a system programming language based on C. It is an evolution of C enabling the same paradigms and 
retaining the same syntax as far as possible.

C3 started as an extension of the [C2 language](http://www.c2lang.org/) by [Bas van den Berg](https://github.com/bvdberg). 
It has evolved significantly, not just in syntax but also in regard to error handling, macros, generics and strings.

The C3 compiler can be found on github: [https://github.com/c3lang/c3c](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c).

Binaries are directly downloadable for the following platforms:

- Windows x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-windows.zip), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-windows-with-precompiled-binaries).
- Debian x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-linux.tar.gz), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-debian-with-precompiled-binaries).
- MacOS x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-macos.zip), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-mac-with-precompiled-binaries).

## Features

- Full C ABI compatibility  
- Module system 
- Generic modules
- Design by contract
- Zero overhead errors
- Semantic macro system
- First-class SIMD vector types
- Struct subtyping
- Safe array access using slices
- Easy to use inline assembly
- Cross-platform standard library which includes dynamic containers and strings
- LLVM backend

## Design principles

- Procedural "get things done"-type of language.
- Stay close to C - only change where there is a significant need.
- Flawless C integration.
- Learning C3 should be easy for a C programmer.
- Dare add conveniences if the value is great.
- Data is inert and zero is initialization.
- Avoid "big ideas".
- Avoid the kitchen sink language trap.
